                It came from a highly advanced planet. As it does not seem like a creature from our solar system, it is highly suspected that this creature possesses the ability to travel through time and space. Such a race must have armed with highly advanced weapon that non of human technology can have any hope of defeating it. In order to fight it, constantly press ENTER to fire, but its power can not be undone by normal weapon.
