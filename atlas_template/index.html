                It came from a highly advanced planet. As it does not seem like a creature from our solar system, it is highly suspected that this creature possesses the ability to travel through time and space. Such a race must have armed with highly advanced weapon that non of human technology can have any hope of defeating it. In order to fight it, constantly press ENTER to fire, but its power can not be undone by normal weapon.

            <h3 class="green">Instructions</h3> 
                <p>Refresh the page to get control to the remote control ship, constantly press ENTER to let NBE-3 see you and you can fire at it. Or its radiation will pill off all of your skin and eat the planet in time. If you are too far away from it, it will not shoot you but your drone will be damaged by its radiation. Your drone is just a distraction to it and you can know how strong it is by sacrificing the drone. After destroying the drone, NBE-3 will consume the whole planet. Use the matrix to destroy it once and for all.</p>
