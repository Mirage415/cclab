Cybertron, our home, our once proud. I am Optimus Prime, leader of the Autobots. We were once a peaceful race of an intelligence, mechanical beings,
but then came the war between the Autobots and Decepticons. Our war ravaged our planet until it was consumed by death and fire. Cybertron has fallen, we must
protect our home and defeat Megatron. Let's roll!

Soldier, our war wages on. Your mission is to defend the city, evacuate the citizens, and stop any Decepticons from getting inside.
